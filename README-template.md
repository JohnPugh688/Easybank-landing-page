## Overview

This is my first project working with Jacascript. I spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand each little detail ive added and not just followed along with a tutorial which would have been the easy choice. Javascript for me is a challenge to understand but hopefully with time it will become clearer just like Tailwind has. I hope you will take the time to have a look at my coding and give me some well needed feedback.

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

Ive mainly gained a basic understanding of Javascript. Experimenting with different animations was also fun to try.

### Continued development

Honestly i think im going to give React a go. I dont have much Javascript experience but i also dont have any css experience either but for me tailwind just works.
